initializing power-on self test.

### // condensed >

i must confess, i had been in a bit of a slump with wanting to get anything done, but i think i have shifted my focus back over and feel a bit better about things.

i originally wrote a long blog about this, mostly to encourage myself to continue on this path. i decided to go ahead and condense it to make it easier to read.

up to this point, i had already done research into topics that i enjoy, but my path forwarded has always been fragmented leaving me unable to decide exactly how i want to go about things. i think the important thing is to just get started somewhere.

back in the day, there really wasn't anyone to learn from and we just did things for fun. it wasn't specifically to learn, but i suppose that was one of the benefits of screwing around with technology as a kid. my reasons back then were just to have fun and cause mischief.

anyway, this is just a reminder to myself of why i do things today.

reasons for wanting to get into exploit development:

- the potential to learn new things.
- new opportunities.
- profit.
- leverage against a cyber-punk dystopian future.
- knowledge to pass along to younger generations.

getting started:

- research and review some existing exploits.
- build test environment to reproduce exploits for learning.
- document the steps to reproduce exploits.

follow-up:

- start identifying vulnerabilities on my own.
- build exploits for the vulnerabilities that I find.
- profit.

i think it is important to remind myself as well; if you treat things as work, you will find yourself resisting it and not getting anything done. instead, treat it as a journey for knowledge.
