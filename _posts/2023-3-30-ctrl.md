hi. i've been neglecting you. i'm sorry. i'm trying.

### // radio >

i took the ameteur radio technician license and passed. i've been learning about the ameteur bands and the different services/modes offered. once i feel comfortable enough, i want to start playing around with the sdr dongle that i bought, but i'm also putting together a nice portable rig to start trying park/summit activations. i'll make sure to post the details of my rig once i have it all put together and tested.

i know i haven't been paying attention to this blog at all. time to start giving it some love. i am working towards a nice minimal layout, but these fonts suck. hopefully i can get around to changing up the fonts soon. perhaps much sooner than you think.

i've been putting off a large amount of work in lieu of fucking off and not getting shit done. i suppose this blog is a reflection of that, since it has been nearly a year since i put any work into it.

not really sure what else to do with this post since it is the first official one and haven't put much thought into what i wanted to say.

i suppose i should use this section for anything that i'm actively working on. at the moment, other than this blog, i'm only working on my man-portable radio operator rig. waiting on some coax cables and right angle connectors, as well as some digirig connectors to drop in so I can start running some tests.

rig so far:

- icom ic-706
- armoloq tpa-706
- digirig
- eberlestock bandit pack
- bioenno 12v lifepo battery pack

the plan is to build out some random-wire, dipole antennas (maybe a single adjustable one) for 10 meters and lower, and use some 2m/70cm whips for 2 meter where possible. really curious to do some propagation testing on 10 meters and lower to see what is possible on those bands.

so far i've only done some testing on local repeaters with my baofeng handheld and btech mobile station.

i'm still trying to figure out how i want to format these posts. i'm liking it so far, so we'll see if i just run with this. that's it for now.
