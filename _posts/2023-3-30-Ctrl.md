hi. i've been neglecting you. i'm sorry. i'm trying.

### radio

i took the ameteur radio technician license and passed. i've been learning about the ameteur bands and the different services/modes offered. once i feel comfortable enough, i want to start playing around with the sdr dongle that i bought, but i'm also putting together a nice portable rig to start trying park/summit activations. i'll make sure to post the details of my rig once i have it all put together and tested.

### site

i know i haven't been paying attention to this blog at all. time to start giving it some love. i am working towards a nice minimal layout, but these fonts suck. hopefully i can get around to changing up the fonts soon.
