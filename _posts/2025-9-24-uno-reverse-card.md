is it just me, or am i paranoid? not every day you get an attempted social engineer attack from an potential insider threat, i suppose. i am documenting my analysis of a conversation that i had with a coworker that seemed a bit out of place.

### // message analysis >

so, earlier today, i received a message from a coworker. he had a question on which malware sandbox or analysis tools i use. i gave a quick reply stating that i use vt and crowdstrike's sandbox without additional context to see where the conversation was going.

first image: shows the initial request, followed by the justification of ***i built this for a friend*** and that it is for ***educational purposes***. then i'm asked how i would go about testing it, but i don't provide any info and instead ask more questions.

my impression: he wrote a program and wants to run some analysis on it. ok, sounds good so far. i am interested in malware analysis, and i don't mind sharing my perspective. however, i need more information.

second image: he gives up more details on what he is working with; packed libraries and executables, msi package, syscalls, antimalware scanner bypass, persistence, etc., but nothing too specific. he tells me that he ran it against a bunch of yara rules and it didn't get picked up. bitdefender didn't pick it up either.

my impression: my spidey sense is yelling at me. is this a remcos? perhaps another payload generated by a c2 framework? why the msi package and not fileless pe hidden inside of a stager? let's see where this takes us.

third image: he provides a little more detail. it was written in c and powershell, and has anti-debug and VM detection capabilities. he reitterates the evasion and anti-logging functionalities, but throws out some additional iocs in the mix. again, he tries to reassure me that it is ***truly not malicious***, it was ***built for his friend's business***, that ***people willingly install this as a service***, it is ***grey***, and that its purpose is to deceive ***guardian browser***.

my impression: bullshit. you're telling me, after describing a fuckin' rat and stager, that i'm supposed to believe this is greyware and that it isn't malicious? all for what, to bypass a proctoring software? what the actual fuck?

fourth image: he adds that ***it will be seen from a c2*** if it is installed. he asks for a way to send it to me, so i picked out a gmail account that i took over a while back and dumped it in chat. obviously he can't make this publicly available on github as that would risk it getting analyzed and detected by EDR vendors.

my impression: ah, greyware that hooks back to a c2... got it. i'll play along with his little game--that is, if he actually decides send the files over. i'd expect him to make up a quick proton or tuta account to do so, but we'll see if he can manage to think that far ahead.

### // eof >

i'm not going to sit here and pretend i'm the best at social engineering, but holy shit was this terrible. i suppose this is what happens when an over-zealous skid gets his hands on a new toy.

part of me still thinks i should give him the benefit of the doubt and think of it as just posturing by an insecure, attention-starved douchebag.

what the fuck ever. if he decides to send over some malware, i'll see if i can do a write-up on my analysis of it.
