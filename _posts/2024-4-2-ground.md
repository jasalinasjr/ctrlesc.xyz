overdue updates.

### // los >

i had already considered running updates on here, but never got around to doing it. it's been a struggle to really give a shit about stuff lately. i just happened to be looking into ogp and wanted to test a few things out using this blog, but things didn't pan out the way i was hoping. i think i need another host and website to run those test cases.

here's hoping i keep adding to this blog... oh, and don't forget to patch your shit.
