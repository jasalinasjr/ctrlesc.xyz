can it happen with a closed mind?

### // memcpy() >

i downloaded a js file the other day that ended up being an extremely obfuscated qakbot dropper. i wanted to keep it to try deobfuscating it to see what it was ultimately doing, but i felt like i didn't have the time. aside from that, stupid defender ate it, so i lost the file and couldn't remember where i downloaded it from. i definitely won't miss out on another opportunity to de-obfuscate and analyze something like that again.



### // block_list >

i created a blocklist for pihole. these are just random domains that i have come across and decided to block becasue they are likely malicious.

check the repository out here: [Pihole Blocklist](https://github.com/jsalinas212/pihole_blocklist)

i'll continue to update this list as i come across more malicious domains.
