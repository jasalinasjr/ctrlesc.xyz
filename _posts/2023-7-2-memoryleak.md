can it happen with a closed mind?

### // memcpy() >

don't be so opened minded that your brain falls out.

i just finished reformatting two of my main machines with arch linux. i've been spending most of my time configuring shit, so i haven't had much time for anything else.

### // malwarez >

i downloaded a js file the other day that ended up being an extremely obfuscated qakbot dropper. i wanted to keep it to try deobfuscating it to see what it was ultimately doing, but i felt like i didn't have the time. aside from that, stupid defender ate it, so i lost the file and couldn't remember where i downloaded it from. i definitely won't miss out on another opportunity to de-obfuscate and analyze something like that again.

i made a malware repository to keep any samples i come across archived. you can find that here: [malwarez](https://github.com/jsalinas212/malwarez)

at some point, i'll get around to deobfuscating this thing to pull some info out of it. for now, i just created a separate branch in the local repo so i can have a look at it.

### // block_list >

i created a blocklist for pihole. these are just random domains that i have come across and decided to block becasue they are likely malicious.

check the repository out here: [pihole blocklist](https://github.com/jsalinas212/pihole_blocklist)

i'll continue to update this list as i come across more malicious domains.

### // eof >

i'll keep this one short and sweet.
