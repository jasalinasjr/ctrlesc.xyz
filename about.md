everyone close to me knows me as `adan`. i go by the handle `an0malous` (for now). i'm a `cybersecurity engineer` at my job, but i larp as a `security researcher` in my spare time.

i started this blog to have a place to write about the projects i'm working on and to keep my notes organized. so... mostly for myself, but maybe some of this stuff can be of use to someone else out there--who knows.
