hi--welcome to my blog.

everyone close to me knows me as `adan`. i go by the handle `an0malous` (for now). i'm a `cybersecurity engineer` at my job, but i am a `hacker` and `security researcher` in my spare time.

i started this blog to have a place to write about the projects i'm working on and to keep my notes organized. so, mostly for myself, but i hope some of these articles can be of use to someone else out there--perhaps even inspire someone to find their own path forward as a security researcher.

i'll try and keep on topic as much as possible, but i do tend to over-analyze things and may rant or go on a tangent every so often.
